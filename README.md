# Features

InternLM2.5-7B-Chat is used as the base model, and the data distilled from deepseek R1 and the data related to psychological counseling is used to train a psychological counseling model with emotion analysis and reasoning ability. At the same time, we try to make the model learn from the dialogue four steps of crosstalk (talk - handle - live - bottom) to carry out counseling, and dynamically switch roles according to the user's dialogue (for example, when the user is the storyteller, the task of the model is to help him explore; If the user expects the model to give some suggestions, then the model is the storyteller.)
